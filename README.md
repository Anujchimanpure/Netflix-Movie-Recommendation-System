# Netflix-Movie-Recommendation-System

A content-based movie recommendation system inspired by Netflix, built using Machine Learning, Python, and Streamlit.
The system recommends movies similar to a user-entered title based on textual similarity and enriches results with live poster data.


With the rapid growth of digital streaming platforms, users are often overwhelmed by the vast amount of available content.
This project aims to recommend relevant movies to users by analyzing similarities between movie descriptions and metadata.

The system:
-Accepts a movie name as input
-Identifies similar movies using a similarity model
-Displays recommendations in a Netflix-style UI
-Fetches movie posters dynamically using the OMDb API
